  Note: Both the slick2d libraries and any sprites used have been excluded from
the repository due to raised concerns over copyright issues. The concern is
that a public repository allows for distribution without expressed consent of
the proper owner. Thus, purely the source code written by myself is included.

The game has a class per entity type, one class per level (only 1 originally),
and one for the main menu. The majority of the logic is within the level and
within mario's class.
